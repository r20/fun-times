Fun Times is an Expo react-native app.

Fun Times helps you find and celebrate quirky numeric milestones for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.

* Enter events like birthdays and weddings.  You can also select from a standard list of events (like the next Super Bowl).
* See the elapsed time since past events, or time until future events.
* See suggested times for when to celebrate events (e.g. 10,000 days since Maria's Birthday)
* Add celebration times to your device calendar to receive notifications when they are about to occur.
* Settings allow you to control which types of numbers are used to calculate celebration times.

Calendar permissions are required for creating calendar entries with notifications for selected celebration times.
